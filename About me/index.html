      <p class="paragraph"><i>Gaming is good There are many kind of videogames such as role playing games, third person shooter, real time strategy and first person shooters. In all of these genres first person shooters and third person shooters are the most played game genre and it is also the most controversial. They are controversial because they are the most violent and censored games, but nobody stops kids from playing them. Some people say that these games make kids more aggressive and violence. Some people think that these games encourage other to start massacre like Adam Lanza did in Newtown school. Adam Lanza killed many kids from elementary school in Newtown. The main reason according to people he did it is he played violent video games mostly first person shooters a lot which encouraged him to do that. In 2011 there was a shooting in a Norwegian summer camp where the shooter killed many kids in that camp. When he was captured and asked in court why he did it, he answered that he was training for it by playing a lot of call of duty. But most people aren’t considering the minority of this kind of incident. Video games don’t promote violent behavior but they do benefit people many ways. If the one person gets the wrong idea about game and goes to do something horribly wrong, that doesn’t mean that everybody will go crazy which will affect whole gaming community. Video games are not always bad but in fact they have more benefits then dangers. For example, video games boost your hand eye coordination.</i></p>

      <p class="paragraph"><i>Having perfect hand eye coordination can be useful in many daily tasks. Scientists have known since 1980s that playing video games even for a short amount of time will boost hand eye coordination. Many surgeons have to perform laparoscopic surgeries that require perfect hand eye coordination. According to Verena Dobnik of NBC news, the surgeons who play videogames at least three hours a week have 37 percent fewer mistake during the surgery and they also finish 27 percent faster than their counter parts. Dr. James "Butch" Rosser, 49, said “I use the same hand-eye coordination to play video games as I use for surgery,". According to him video games are the best way to improve our hand eye coordination even at his age. My cousin is also medical student, who usually comes across the surgeries in which they have to use robotic arms. I see him playing videogames a lot and when I ask him the reason to play video games he replies that their professors recommends playing video games to become better at robotic surgeries. The second benefit of the video games is speeding up one’s reaction time. studies have shown that playing video games especially shooter games will speed up your reaction time. I would consider myself a gamer because the fact that I play lot of video games. I always play first person shooter game named “call of duty” online with other players. During the gameplay, people playing have to make quick decisions and react quickly to stay alive in the game. Delay of half second could mean death in the game and in everybody else’ mind they would not want to die and wait for 5 minutes for next round to start so they will try hard to kill you and throw you out of the game. In this kind of situation, you will have to respond quickly to stay alive in the game. Research done by researchers at the university of Rochester shows that video game players develop a heightened sensitivity to what is going on around them, and this benefit doesn’t just make them better at playing video games, but it also improves other general skill like quicker decision and fast reaction. “It’s not the case that the action game players are trigger-happy and less accurate: They are just as accurate and also faster,” says Daphne Bavelier. “Action game players make more correct decisions per unit time. If you are a surgeon or you are in the middle of a battlefield, that can make all the difference.” Here Daphne says that the people who play shooter games and action</i></p>

        <p class="paragraph"><i>For years video games have been criticised for making people more antisocial, overweight or depressed. But now researchers are finding that games can actually change us for the better and improve both our body and mind.

            Games can help to develop physical skills. Pre-school children who played interactive games such as the ones available on Wii have been shown to have improved motor skills, for example they can kick, catch and throw a ball better than children who don’t play video games. A study of surgeons who do microsurgery in Boston found that those who played video games were 27 per cent faster and made 37 per cent fewer errors than those who didn't. Vision is also improved, particularly telling the difference between shades of grey. This is useful for driving at night, piloting a plane or reading X-rays.
            
            Games also benefit a variety of brain functions, including decision-making. People who play action-based games make decisions 25 per cent faster than others and are no less accurate, according to one study. It was also found that the best gamers can make choices and act on them up to six times a second, four times faster than most people. In another study by researchers from the University of Rochester in New York, experienced gamers were shown to be able to pay attention to more than six things at once without getting confused, compared with the four that most people can normally keep in mind. Additionally, video games can also reduce gender differences. Scientists have found that women who play games are better able to mentally manipulate 3D objects.
            
            There is also evidence that gaming can help with psychological problems. At the University of Auckland in New Zealand, researchers asked 94 young people diagnosed with depression to play a 3D fantasy game called SPARX and in many cases, the game reduced symptoms of depression more than conventional treatment. Another research team at Oxford University found that playing Tetris shortly after exposure to something very upsetting – in the experiment, a film of traumatic scenes of injury and death was used – can actually prevent people having disturbing flashbacks.
            
            The effects are not always so positive, however. Indiana University researchers carried out brain scans on young men and found evidence that violent games can alter brain function after as little as a week of play, affecting regions in the brain associated with emotional control and causing more aggressive behaviour in the player. But Daphne Bavelier, one of the most experienced researchers in the field, says that the violent action games that often worry parents most may actually have the strongest beneficial effect on the brain. In the future, we may see many treatments for physical and neurological problems which incorporate the playing of video games.
